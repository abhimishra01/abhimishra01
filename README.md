<h1 align="center"> Welcome </h1>

- I work as a software engineer - II at [Oqu AI](https://www.oqu.ai/)
---
I build AI systems that eliminate manual work at scale.

My recent work automated financial document underwriting for a lending platform reducing a daily manual workload by 80% using a single AI agent accelerating client onboarding and credit decisions without adding headcount.

I specialise in two areas where AI delivers the highest ROI for businesses:

- Document Intelligence - automated extraction, validation, and analysis of financial statements, bank statements, KYC documents, and compliance filings
- Conversational AI & Chatbots - production-grade chatbots and AI agents integrated with CRMs, email systems, and business workflows

With 4+ years of full-stack engineering experience across JavaScript and Python, I bridge the gap between AI capabilities and real business outcomes. I've worked across fintech, lending, payments, and SaaS, building systems that close paying clients, not just demos.

Tech stack: Node.js, Python, FastAPI, NestJS, ReactJS, OpenAI/LLM APIs, AWS, Redis, Docker, Pipedrive, HubSpot, Puppeteer.

Currently based in Lucknow. Open to remote roles and freelance engagements globally.

If you're building something in fintech, document-heavy, SAAS or any other workflows and need AI that actually works in production - let's talk.
